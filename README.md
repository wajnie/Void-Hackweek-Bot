# Void HackWeek Bot
A discord bot for HackWeek. A moderation one.
## APIs i used
### discord.js
Very basic discord API. Not much to say about, basic stuff.
### fs
JSON (and other) file management. It's used for warn commands, where you have to store how much warns does an user have.
### ms
It's an API that can accept other arguments than miliseconds only. Example: `12h`, `5s`, `10m`, `1.5d`...

## Quick Introduction
The bot itself has 9 commands. If you mention it it shows an embed which displays basic information like server prefix, how you can change it, very basic stuff. It took me 3 days to make it.
