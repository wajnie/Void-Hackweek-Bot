# Void HackWeek Bot
A discord bot for HackWeek. A moderation one.
## APIs i used:
`discord.js` (discord api)
`fs` (for json file management)
`ms` (for accepting arguments like 1h, 1s, 10s, ect.)

The bot itself has 9 commands. If you mention it it shows an embed which displays basic information like server prefix, how you can change it, very basic stuff. It took me 3 days to make it.
