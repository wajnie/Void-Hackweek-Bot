# Void HackWeek Bot
A discord bot for HackWeek. A moderation one.
## APIs I used
### discord.js
Discord.js is a node.js a module which interacts with Discord API. I've picked it because it's the most commonly used API to create JavaScript bots.
### fs
JSON (and other) file management. It's used for warning commands, where you have to store how much warns does a user have.
### ms
It's an API that can accept other arguments than milliseconds only. Example: `12h`, `5s`, `10m`, `1.5d`...
### array-sort
It's used for `invitelb` command. Sorts arrays.
## Quick Introduction
The bot itself is no copyrighted. You can steall all my code if you want. If you decide to mention the bot, it will show basic information like server prefix, how you can change it, very basic stuff. It took me 3 days to make it. Suddenly the bot isn't hosted, but you can add that code to your bot. It should work.
